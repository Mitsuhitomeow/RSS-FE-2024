# My TypeScript Journey: Earned Badges üèÜ

## Badges Overview

Here is a collection of badges I earned from completing Microsoft Learn's TypeScript modules:

1. **Getting Started with TypeScript**: [Badge](https://learn.microsoft.com/api/achievements/share/ru-ru/MelnikovAlexey-3052/UF5HUM43?sharingId=C4777D89382D1FFA)
2. **Declare Variable Types in TypeScript**: [Badge](https://learn.microsoft.com/api/achievements/share/en-gb/MelnikovAlexey-3052/UF5HUM43?sharingId=C4777D89382D1FFA)
3. **Implement Interfaces in TypeScript**: [Badge](https://learn.microsoft.com/api/achievements/share/en-gb/MelnikovAlexey-3052/WAC78WSN?sharingId=C4777D89382D1FFA)
4. **Develop Typed Functions in TypeScript**: [Badge](https://learn.microsoft.com/api/achievements/share/ru-ru/MelnikovAlexey-3052/24X6Z93V?sharingId=C4777D89382D1FFA)

## Reflections

1. In the first module, I learned a bit about the purpose of TypeScript, its capabilities for compiling to JavaScript, and static typing of variables. I also got acquainted with the tsconfig file at a superficial level (I was given a chance to try reconfiguring it), installed TypeScript, and tried it out in practice.

2. I learned more about data types, explored various kinds. I practiced and mastered primitive types, got acquainted with new ones like enum, any, and unknown (spent an hour grappling with "type assertion" due to poorly explained concept, had to resort to additional information online). Throughout the module, I practiced using intersection, union, and literal types. I learned to type arrays and compose tuples. At the end, there were four interesting tasks offered, which helped solidify the material.

3. Expanded my understanding of interfaces in TypeScript and type aliases, mastered declaring and extending interfaces. Additionally, learned how to create indexed types, their structure, and how to use them to describe APIs. Solidified my knowledge through engaging exercises on interface usage provided by the module. At this point, I have nothing more to add except that the module aided me in gaining a deeper comprehension of interfaces.

4. In this module, I learned how to create various functions in TypeScript, type parameters, and return values of functions. I learned how to assign types to both required and optional parameters, whether they are arrays or objects. Practice helped me better understand how to assign types to required, optional, and default parameters. I also explored ways to define function types using type aliases and interfaces and understood their purpose. Finally, as always, it concluded with an interesting task to reinforce my knowledge, which helped me better understand how to write functions in TypeScript.
