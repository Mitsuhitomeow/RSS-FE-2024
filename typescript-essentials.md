## Badges Overview

Here is a collection of badges I earned from completing Microsoft Learn's TypeScript modules:

## Reflections

1. In the first module, I learned a bit about the purpose of TypeScript, its capabilities for compiling to JavaScript, and static typing of variables. I also got acquainted with the tsconfig file at a superficial level (I was given a chance to try reconfiguring it), installed TypeScript, and tried it out in practice.

2. I learned more about data types, explored various kinds. I practiced and mastered primitive types, got acquainted with new ones like enum, any, and unknown (spent an hour grappling with "type assertion" due to poorly explained concept, had to resort to additional information online). Throughout the module, I practiced using intersection, union, and literal types. I learned to type arrays and compose tuples. At the end, there were four interesting tasks offered, which helped solidify the material.
