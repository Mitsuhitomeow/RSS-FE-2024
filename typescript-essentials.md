## Reflections

1. In the first module, I learned a bit about the purpose of TypeScript, its capabilities for compiling to JavaScript, and static typing of variables. I also got acquainted with the tsconfig file at a superficial level (I was given a chance to try reconfiguring it), installed TypeScript, and tried it out in practice.

2. I learned more about data types, explored various kinds. I practiced and mastered primitive types, got acquainted with new ones like enum, any, and unknown (spent an hour grappling with "type assertion" due to poorly explained concept, had to resort to additional information online). Throughout the module, I practiced using intersection, union, and literal types. I learned to type arrays and compose tuples. At the end, there were four interesting tasks offered, which helped solidify the material.

3. Expanded my understanding of interfaces in TypeScript and type aliases, mastered declaring and extending interfaces. Additionally, learned how to create indexed types, their structure, and how to use them to describe APIs. Solidified my knowledge through engaging exercises on interface usage provided by the module. At this point, I have nothing more to add except that the module aided me in gaining a deeper comprehension of interfaces.

4. In this module, I learned how to create various functions in TypeScript, type parameters, and return values of functions. I learned how to assign types to both required and optional parameters, whether they are arrays or objects. Practice helped me better understand how to assign types to required, optional, and default parameters. I also explored ways to define function types using type aliases and interfaces and understood their purpose. Finally, as always, it concluded with an interesting task to reinforce my knowledge, which helped me better understand how to write functions in TypeScript.

5. In the fifth module, I learned the fundamentals of declaring classes, assigning types to class arguments, understanding the concept of class instances, and utilizing access modifiers such as private, protected, and static. Additionally, I explored class extension through the use of extends, enabling the creation of class hierarchies, as well as defining interfaces for classes to make code more flexible and structured. At the end of the module, tasks were provided to reinforce the material, and I saw firsthand how functions from previous modules could be transformed into class methods, enhancing my understanding of object-oriented programming principles in practice.

6. I got acquainted with universal templates, found out what they are needed for and in what cases, and also talked about various ways to use them. They showed how to declare universal templates in functions, interfaces, and classes. And, as always, in the end, the task is to consolidate knowledge.

7. This module, in essence, didn't provide me with anything new in terms of knowledge. I was already familiar with exports and imports, except for compiling `tsc --module` into `es6` or `commonjs`. What was new for me was the type library, as well as working with `.env` and `dotenv`, although the topic hasn't been fully explored yet. It is mentioned that `.env` contains certain project environments. Also, as always, there was a task where files needed to be imported in such a way that the end result was a fully functional output of functions.

8. I learned about namespaces and how they help to organize code, including single-file and multi-file namespaces. Solving the problem provided an opportunity to strengthen my understanding of the material.
