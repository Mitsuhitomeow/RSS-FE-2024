1. In the first module, I learned a bit about the purpose of TypeScript, its capabilities for compiling to JavaScript, and static typing of variables. I also got acquainted with the tsconfig file at a superficial level (I was given a chance to try reconfiguring it), installed TypeScript, and tried it out in practice.
