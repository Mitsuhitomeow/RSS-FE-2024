Hello everyone! My name is Alexey, and I am a student of the frontend development course at "RS School". I came here for practice and unique knowledge that cannot be found anywhere else. I am already 26 years old, and I have two degrees: secondary special and higher education, but they are not related to the field of development.

At the beginning of my studies, it was very difficult. there was a lot of information, and it was very easy to get lost in it, as well as to burn out. That's how I found out about RS School. I got there without any basic knowledge, thinking it was just another lecture like on YouTube. "Oh, how wrong I was,‚Äù. This course ground me up and spit me out. However, I immediately understood the advantages of this course. In this short time, I already learned how to design landing pages, deploy them, and use Git at a basic level. I learned about development tools, libraries, that programming is far from just one language. That's when I realized how much I already know, and if I had been prepared in advance at the beginning.

Now, studying on the course, more or less perfectly performing tasks, I categorically declare how little I still know! And how much I still have to learn!  I also enjoy going to the voice channel in Discord at the end of the day, where there are the same students who share knowledge, successes, and failures. There you understand that you are not alone and that you don't know something.

My goals are very simple. I hope to become a developer by the age of 30. I don't know how optimistic my goals are, but the route is planned, and there's nowhere to turn back.

I apologize in advance if anyone expected to hear a "saga of incredible experience". It doesn't mean it doesn't exist at all. It does,  but it's very little. Stories like "made adaptive design on the client's website by request or participated in a project on another website, worked on button layout on React/Next.js, really enjoyed working with this framework, practice with button creation helped me understand the principles of the component approach deeper, in the future, I plan to take the React course from rsschool."

I want to express my special thanks to all the course teachers and mentors for being ready to share their knowledge and guide students at the cost of their time. I also thank the activists who also find time to help in Discord.

That's where I'll end my story. Thank you for your attention and time spent.
